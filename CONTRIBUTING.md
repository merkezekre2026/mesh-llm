This file covers local build and development workflows for this repository.

## Prerequisites

- `just`
- `cmake`
- Rust toolchain (`cargo`)
- `sccache` (required by the repository Cargo configuration)
- Node.js 24 + pnpm 10 or newer (for UI development). The UI lockfile keeps
  `overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which pnpm 9 does not read, so pnpm 9
  cannot install it. `corepack pnpm@10` is enough if your host pnpm is older.

Install the pinned compiler cache and the platform linkers with:

```bash
just bootstrap-build-tools
```

The bootstrap installs sccache 0.16.0. On Linux it also installs mold and lld
with the detected system package manager; on macOS it installs lld with
Homebrew. On Windows it installs the Rust LLVM tools with rustup. Set
`MESH_LLM_SCCACHE_VERSION` only when deliberately testing a newer cache binary.

**macOS**: Apple Silicon. Metal is used automatically. Install the accelerated
linker with `brew install lld`; the repository probes `ld64.lld` against the
active SDK and uses Apple ld when that installed version is incompatible.

**Linux**: install `mold` and `lld`. Cargo uses mold by default and retains lld
as the diagnosed compatibility fallback. On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mold lld
```

**Linux NVIDIA**: x86_64 with an NVIDIA GPU. Requires the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc` in your `PATH`). On Arch Linux, CUDA is typically at `/opt/cuda`; on Ubuntu/Debian it's at `/usr/local/cuda`. Auto-detection finds the right SM architecture for your GPU.

**Linux AMD**: ROCm/HIP is supported when ROCm is installed. Typical installs expose `hipcc`, `hipconfig`, and `rocm-smi` under `/opt/rocm/bin`.

**Linux Vulkan**: Vulkan is supported when the Vulkan development files and `glslc` are installed. On Ubuntu/Debian, install `libvulkan-dev glslc`. On Arch Linux, install `vulkan-headers shaderc`.

**Windows**: native runtime builds support `cuda`, `hip`/`rocm`, `vulkan`, or
`cpu`. Metal is not supported on Windows. Install the Rust lld tools with
`rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`, or install LLVM with `winget install
LLVM.LLVM`.

## Build from source

Build the normal debug product: a backend-neutral dynamic host, its adjacent
locally packaged native runtime, and the UI:

```bash
just build
```

Release and packaging use the same host/runtime boundary. The only lower-level
static compilation primitive is runtime packaging; it never builds a host.
Build a release host once:

```bash
just release-host-build
```

Then build the backend runtime you are changing:

```bash
just release-runtime-build cpu
just release-runtime-build metal
just release-runtime-build cuda
just release-runtime-build rocm
just release-runtime-build vulkan
```

Backend toolchains must be available for the corresponding runtime build. For
NVIDIA on Linux, put `nvcc` on `PATH`; runtime packaging detects the selected
CUDA major and architecture from the toolchain/environment.

```bash
PATH=/opt/cuda/bin:$PATH just release-runtime-build cuda
# or
PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH just release-runtime-build cuda
```

Exercise the exact release discovery boundary with an isolated cache:

```bash
runtime_cache="$(mktemp -d)"
MESH_LLM_NATIVE_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_DIR="$PWD/dist/native-runtimes" \
MESH_LLM_NATIVE_RUNTIME_CACHE_DIR="$runtime_cache" \
  ./target/release/mesh-llm runtime list
```

The resolver validates version, Skippy ABI, OS, architecture, and backend. It
does not search the current working directory or copy a matching bundled
runtime into the user cache.

Create a portable product bundle after building both layers:

```bash
just release-bundle v0.X.0 dist
```

## UI development workflow

The React console and embedded asset crate live in `crates/mesh-llm-ui/`.
The host binary serves the built assets through the management API.

Use this two-terminal flow for UI development.

Terminal A (run `mesh-llm` yourself):

```bash
mesh-llm --port 9337 --console 3131
```

If `mesh-llm` is not on your `PATH`:

```bash
./target/release/mesh-llm --port 9337 --console 3131
```

Terminal B (run Vite with HMR):

```bash
just ui-dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

`ui-dev` defaults:

- Serves on `127.0.0.1:5173`
- Proxies `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:3131`

Overrides:

```bash
# Different backend API origin for /api proxy
just ui-dev http://127.0.0.1:4141

# Different Vite dev port
just ui-dev http://127.0.0.1:3131 5174
```

## Desktop app workflow

The Tauri desktop app lives in `desktop/` as its own cargo workspace (it is
excluded from the root workspace because it needs platform webview libraries).
It bundles the regular `mesh-llm` binary as a sidecar and shows the console
that binary serves.

```bash
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked
just build          # debug mesh-llm product
just desktop-dev    # run the app against target/debug/mesh-llm
just desktop-check  # fmt, clippy -D warnings, unit tests
just desktop-bundle # release host + runtime, then platform installers
```

See [desktop/README.md](desktop/README.md) for Linux system packages, the app
architecture, and packaging details.

## Useful commands

```bash
just stop             # stop mesh/rpc/llama processes
just test             # quick test against :9337
just check-release    # release-target/docs/workflow parity check
just compat-smoke ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/<model>.gguf   # optional 2-node + 1-client Python/Node/LiteLLM smoke
just --list           # list all recipes
```

On macOS and Linux, local Cargo artifacts are bounded independently from the sccache
compiler-object cache, which here keeps sccache's own 10 GiB local default. That default is
a developer-machine limit only -- CI does not use it, and pins a 2 GiB trusted seed instead
(`SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE=2G`, see `.github/actions/restore-sccache-seed`). Inspect and prune the
local Cargo artifacts with:

```bash
just cache-status
just cache-prune-dry-run max_size=80GiB max_age=14
just cache-prune max_size=80GiB max_age=14
```

Pruning evicts the oldest incremental sessions first, then uses
`cargo clean -p` for old or size-dominant workspace packages. It is scoped to
this worktree's `target/` and reports before/after bytes. On macOS and Linux,
`just build` and `just build-dev` hold a shared lock for their full build while
cache status and dry-run pruning take the same lock in shared mode. Executed
pruning requires the corresponding exclusive lock before measuring or deleting
artifacts. Direct Cargo and lower-level build commands do not share that lock,
so pruning also refuses to run when it detects an active Cargo or Rust compiler
process as a best-effort safeguard. Cargo configurations that separate
`build.build-dir` from `target-dir` are rejected because the cache manager does
not report, lock, or clean a second artifact tree.

On native Windows, `just check-release` runs the host-safe Rust/doc invariant subset and skips the Bash-only `install.sh` / `package-release.sh` parity checks. Run it on macOS or Linux when you need full shell parity coverage.

### Line endings on native Windows

`.gitattributes` checks every text file out with LF on every platform. A
checkout created before that landed, with `core.autocrlf=true`, keeps its CRLF
working copy until the files are re-extracted, and five host-runtime tests
still fail locally on content they read verbatim: both `config_schema`
snapshots, the `plugin::config` fixture, `inference::skippy::topology`, which
greps its own source, and `inference::skippy::split_certification`, whose
`build.rs` patch-queue digest is hashed from the bytes of the llama.cpp
patches and gates production split certification rather than tests alone.

Renormalise once, after committing or stashing anything in progress, since the
second command discards uncommitted work:

```powershell
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard HEAD
```

`git ls-files --eol` should then report `i/lf w/lf` for every text file. A
fresh clone needs none of this.

### Testing crates on native Windows

A bare Windows checkout cannot build the test targets of crates that pull in
`skippy-ffi`'s static link mode (`mesh-llm-system` does, through
`mesh-llm-runtime-install`, which depends on `skippy-ffi` with
`default-features = false`), because `skippy-ffi/build.rs` then requires
the llama.cpp ABI archives to be prepared
(`automatic native preparation is not supported for Windows from build.rs yet`).
`just test-all` needs the same native preparation, through its Bash pipeline.

For crate suites that do not exercise the native runtime, enable
`dynamic-native-runtime`: feature unification turns on `skippy-ffi`'s
`dynamic-runtime`, whose build script returns early. The `mesh-llm-system`
gates then run on a machine without a prepared native build:

```powershell
cargo test --locked -p mesh-llm-system --lib --features dynamic-native-runtime
cargo clippy --no-deps -p mesh-llm-system --all-targets --features dynamic-native-runtime -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check -p mesh-llm-system
cargo run -p xtask -- repo-consistency no-console-print
```

`--no-deps` keeps Clippy scoped to the package you are changing. `cfg`-gated
code can be dead on one platform only, so if a platform-specific warning
appears that your diff does not touch, compare the run against the same
command on `main` before attributing it to your change. Running the
native-runtime suites still needs a prepared build (`LLAMA_STAGE_BUILD_DIR`
or `SKIPPY_LLAMA_BUILD_DIR` pointing at one), which this section does not cover.
The Rust MSVC toolchain needs the Visual Studio Build Tools with the
"Desktop development with C++" workload installed.

## Commit messages

Commit subjects follow [Conventional Commits
v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<optional scope>)<optional !>: <description>
```

Install the hook that enforces it:

```bash
just hooks-install          # sets core.hooksPath to scripts/hooks
just check-commits          # validates origin/main..HEAD
```

Git cannot activate a committed hook on clone — that would make `git clone` of
any repository arbitrary code execution — so the hook needs one local opt-in.
`just build` enables it for you on the first local development build, on every
platform, unless you have already pointed `core.hooksPath` somewhere yourself.
CI enforces the same rules regardless, so a clone that never builds is still
covered.

Valid types are `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `security`, `revert`, `refactor`,
`style`, `test`, `build`, `deps`, `ci`, `chore`, and `docs`. This is not
bookkeeping: the release-notes job classifies each release entry from these
subjects, so the type decides which section a change appears under. `feat`
lands in Added, `fix` in Fixed, `perf` in Changed, `security` in Security, and
the tooling types collapse into a folded Internal section. A subject that is
not conventional cannot be classified and lands in "Other changes".

Two overrides exist. `BREAKING CHANGE: <what>` in the body (or `!` after the
type) moves the entry to Changed, whatever its type. `Release-Notes: <Section>` in the body wins
outright — reach for it when the type cannot express the change, above all for
a fix that closes a security exposure and belongs in Security rather than
Fixed.

Because the repository squash-merges, the PR title becomes the commit subject
on `main`. Give the PR the conventional title, not just the branch commits.

The hook is opt-in per clone, so CI is what actually enforces this. The Quality
lane rejects a pull request whose title is not conventional, and rejects any
branch commit carrying a denied attribution trailer, because the squash body
aggregates those messages. Branch commit *subjects* are not judged in CI --
messy work-in-progress subjects are fine, since only the title survives the
squash.

See [`.agents/skills/release-notes/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/release-notes/SKILL.md)
for the full pipeline.

### Attribution trailers

Agent, bot, and relay attribution trailers are not kept in this history. The
hook rejects a commit whose trailers name an agent or bot, use an agent
attribution address such as `noreply@anthropic.com`, sit at a relay identity
domain such as `meshllm.communities.buzz.xyz`, or belong to a `[bot]` account:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>          # rejected
Co-authored-by: scama <a1860575018c46@meshllm.communities.buzz.xyz>  # rejected
Co-authored-by: coderabbitai[bot] <...@users.noreply.github.com>     # rejected
Co-authored-by: Real Person <real@example.com>                  # kept
```

Trailers naming a human contributor are untouched. Extend the lists in
`scripts/check-conventional-commit.py` when a new agent identity shows up.

A squash merge builds the commit on `main` from the pull request title and
body, both of which CI validates, so a trailer in a branch commit cannot reach
`main` on its own. Keep them out of branch commits anyway: branch history is
still read during review, and that protection is a repository setting rather
than a law of nature. See the CI notes in
[`.agents/skills/manage-ci/references/current-inventory.md`](.agents/skills/manage-ci/references/current-inventory.md).


## CI / GitHub Actions

For the current PR and main topology, read [`ci/ci.md`](ci/ci.md), the
[optimization spec](.omo/specs/pr-ci-optimization.md), and the canonical
[`manage-ci` skill](.agents/skills/manage-ci/SKILL.md) before editing CI.
`.github/AGENTS.md` enforces that sequence.

The current five-way PR/main topology, manual controller, planner profiles,
and runner/provider/cache policy are documented in [`ci/ci.md`](ci/ci.md),
especially [Planner and profiles](ci/ci.md#planner-and-profiles) and [Provider
and cache policy](ci/ci.md#provider-and-cache-policy). The normative rules for
editing workflows and CI scripts live in the [`manage-ci` skill](.agents/skills/manage-ci/SKILL.md).

When a pull request changes workflow YAML, local actions, planner contracts,
runner selection, or other CI plumbing, apply the `ci:canary` label to request
the optional non-required diagnostic. It builds the pull-request merge commit
through one real hosted Linux amd64 CPU chain (UI artifact, release host,
native runtime including its runtime-event gate, and product composition).
The PR head SHA is retained as separate identity evidence. The canary does not
cover the five required lane orchestrators, macOS, Windows, GPU, SDK, smoke,
or release paths. The canary lane and runner-policy actions come from protected
`main`; the merge commit is used only as the product source. Remove the label to
cancel an active run.

Linux CI uses prebuilt public and self-hosted images from
[`Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm-runner-images`](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm-runner-images).
CPU, Vulkan, versioned CUDA, and versioned ROCm images share a core environment,
warm dependencies from MeshLLM's checked-in manifests, and allow container
runtimes to reuse cached layers where the runner host or K3s node retains them
instead of reinstalling host packages in every job.

If CI is missing a dependency, update the appropriate MeshLLM manifest and
lockfile or the runner image's YAML profile/installer, then publish the image
and pin its OCI digest. Do not add a one-off `apt-get`, `pip`, global `npm`,
`cargo install`, downloaded binary, or similar setup step to an individual
workflow. Existing workflow-local setup is migration debt, not a pattern for
new jobs.

### Local validation and extensions

Run the narrow checks that match the change, plus the full contract suite for
workflow changes:

```bash
just ci-validate
```

The canonical complete local gate is `just test-all`; it includes repository
consistency, Rust formatting, Clippy, Rust tests, UI/docs builds, and E2E smoke.
Use `just ci-shellcheck <changed-script>...` for changed shell scripts and
`just check-release` when release-target consistency is in scope. These are the
complete CI-definition and worktree checks; narrow checks do not replace
`just test-all` when full repository validation is required.

Planner fixtures and the CI repository-consistency recipes are included in
`just ci-validate`. Use `just ci-crate-lists`, `just check-release`, or
`just publish-crates` when iterating on the corresponding narrower contract.

To add coverage, extend one typed reusable slice or local action, update the
ownership/dependency/row catalog and planner fixtures, preserve immutable
producer-to-consumer reachability, and add the slice to its lane's stable
summary. Keep the controller's bounded projection and aggregate check contract
in sync. Never copy a PR job into an entrypoint or accept a raw runner label.
Validate the GitHub fallback before any provider rollout.

## GPU benchmark execution

GPU bandwidth benchmarks are launched through the `mesh-llm` binary itself rather than standalone benchmark executables. The public command remains:

```bash
mesh-llm gpus detect
```

Internally, mesh-llm runs a hidden `benchmark` subcommand in a narrow subprocess boundary so native backend hangs and stdout capture stay isolated from the main process.

Standard builds support benchmark execution only for the backends wired into the normal build flow:

- macOS Apple Silicon: Metal
- Linux / Windows NVIDIA: CUDA
- Linux / Windows AMD: HIP / ROCm

Intel GPU benchmark execution is not currently supported in standard `just build` flows, so runtime benchmark selection intentionally skips Intel GPUs.

## Protocol Backward Compatibility

Any change to `crates/mesh-llm-host-runtime/src/protocol/` or `crates/mesh-client/src/protocol/` requires backward-compatibility tests before merging.

Embedded clients (iOS, macOS, Android) are permanently supported. Protocol changes that break embedded client compatibility are breaking changes.

Run the protocol compatibility tests after any protocol change:

```bash
cargo test -p mesh-llm --test protocol_compat_v0_client
cargo test -p mesh-llm --test protocol_convert_matrix
```

See [`docs/design/EMBEDDED_CLIENT_ADR.md`](docs/design/EMBEDDED_CLIENT_ADR.md) for the full compatibility policy and rationale.
