# MeshLLM CI inventory

This file records checked-in CI facts and selected controlled probe evidence.
It is not a complete historical run log or live GitHub/Depot administration.
Read it with `../SKILL.md` and `ci/ci.md` before editing CI.

The affected-crate fallback roster in `scripts/affected-crates.sh` includes
`mesh-llm-wallet` and `mesh-wallet-lexe` alongside `mesh-llm-payments`;
`just ci-crate-lists` checks it against workspace membership. The publish
chain orders `mesh-llm-plugin` before `mesh-llm-wallet`, then
`mesh-wallet-lexe` and `mesh-llm-payments`, including optional dependencies.

The protected catalogs include `platform-windows-cfg`: ownership of
`mesh-llm-plugin` selects `platform-checks` and its existing `windows-unit`
row. It does not select host/native product builds by itself.

## Entry workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Ownership |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pr_quality.yml` (`PR · Quality`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable Quality lane |
| `pr_website.yml` (`PR · Website`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable Website lane |

| `pr_windows.yml` (`PR · Windows`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable Windows lane |
| `pr_ci_canary.yml` (`PR · CI canary`) | PR lifecycle, `ci:canary` label only | Optional non-required merge-source diagnostic for one hosted Linux CPU product chain; excluded from the five-entry census and sibling cancellation monitor |
| `pr-cancel-sibling-runs.yml` (`PR · Cancel sibling lanes`) | protected `workflow_run` on `PR · Quality` entering progress | No-PR-checkout monitor that cancels other exact-revision PR validation lanes after the first definitive job failure |
| `main_quality.yml` (`Main · Quality`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Quality lane |
| `main_website.yml` (`Main · Website`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Website lane |
| `main_linux.yml` (`Main · Linux`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Linux lane |
| `main_macos.yml` (`Main · macOS`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable macOS lane |
| `main_windows.yml` (`Main · Windows`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Windows lane |
| `ci.yml` | `workflow_call` only | Temporary inert shim for the former main ingress filename; pending protected-main runner-contract update; no push trigger or dispatch |
| `ci-control.yml` (`CI · Manual Full`) | dispatch on default branch | Explicit operator-only full plan, bounded lane dispatch and correlated diagnostic checks |
| `release.yml` | dispatch on the default branch | Canonical version synchronization, release-only signing, assets, publication, post-publish release-notes regrouping, and a preflighted downstream `mesh-packaging` dispatch |
| `resume-crates-release.yml` (`Release · Resume crates.io`) | dispatch on the default branch | Exact-tag, exact-SHA recovery for a partially published stable crates.io chain; uses the immutable release source and the trusted default-branch publisher script |
| `desktop-packages.yml` (`Desktop · Installers`) | dispatch with a stable release `tag` and `attach_to_release` | Non-required desktop installer packaging from an existing release; see "Desktop installers" below |
| `website-pages.yml` | main website paths, dispatch | Public website deployment |
| `pr_cleanup.yml` | PR close, dispatch | Positively matched cleanup only |
| `pr_auto_assign.yml` | PR lifecycle | Metadata only |
| `cache-warm-sccache.yml` (`Cache · Trusted sccache seed`) | successful Main Quality, dispatch | Sole bounded Linux compiler-seed publisher on GitHub-hosted infrastructure |
| `agentic-replay-nightly.yml` (`Agentic Replay Nightly (micstudio)`) | trusted-main dispatch; schedule paused for qualification | Coding-agent serving benchmark on the pinned persistent macOS `micstudio` runner. Scheduled and manual execution is restricted to trusted `main`; exact model and trajectory revisions are SHA-256 verified, the trajectory pin is cross-checked against the canonical harness, replay shape comes from the checked-in matrix, history lookup fails closed, summaries are retained on regressions, and the persistent repair loop receives no publication credential. It emits a patch, PR body and validated run/attempt status artifact; a separate canonical-main, failed-run GitHub-hosted job validates and applies that data with hooks disabled, then uses `CANARY_REPAIR_TOKEN` to publish the deterministic run/attempt repair branch and PR. |


Agentic replay is manual-only while the full-session, long-context workload is
qualified. Restore the former `14:23 UTC` schedule only after reviewed live
calibration. It can queue while the llama canary occupies micstudio. Runner labels retain the
registered `X64` label, but a pre-checkout guard requires native arm64 execution
and working Git/xcrun. The toolchain uses the canonical shared HF cache at
`/Users/lab/models/huggingface`, checks that it is writable, and explicitly sets
`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=0` so missing pinned models and trajectories can be downloaded.
Pinned input verification uses the installed `hf download --format quiet` CLI
for path-only stdout; it does not require Hugging Face in system Python. Model
and trajectory downloads retain revision and SHA-256 checks. A locked replay
Python project supplies DuckDB to the trajectory reader. The history existence
probe uses the standard-library HTTP client and permits bootstrap only on 404.
Replay and repair raise their descriptor limit to 65,536 and use a run-specific
sccache socket, retaining the shared on-disk compiler cache.
Public history reads receive no HF token. The workflow grants repair eligibility
only after successful replay and history retrieval, complete pass/concurrency
coverage, and a gated performance regression against matching hardware history.
Infrastructure errors retain evidence without starting code repair. Cancellation
also preserves available artifacts. The three models run in separate serial steps, each with a 360-minute ceiling,
within a 1,800-minute job. Repair retains its separate 360-minute ceiling.
These ceilings are not measured runtime estimates; calibration must establish
that original and repair verification workloads fit before scheduling.
The repair budget includes both Goose and its complete verification replay.
The agent invocation is bounded to one hour and logged. Goose uses the canary's provider/model settings
(`LLAMA_CANARY_GOOSE_PROVIDER` / `LLAMA_CANARY_GOOSE_MODEL`, default
`zai_coding_plan` / `glm-5.3-flash`), an authentication preflight, the developer
builtin, and a run/attempt-specific named session. Failed or
unchanged agent output and edits to verification/control files publish no PR.
Only a passing repaired benchmark emits a publication artifact. The hosted
publisher uses Conventional Commit titles. Independent verification in a fresh
job, as used by the llama canary, remains a follow-up for this older repair path.

Other scheduled, deployment, Docker, package, canary and cache-warming
workflows are independent of required PR readiness.
`nightly-stability.yml` calls the fixed GitHub-hosted
`nightly-stability-run.yml`; the reusable run executes both the general
stability harness and the existing KV tool-loop/prefix-reuse harness, preserves
both evidence sets, and fails after both have had a chance to run.
`nightly-kv-coverage.yml` is a separate trusted-`main` GitHub-hosted schedule
for a much larger deterministic radix/blob ownership corpus. It uses the
pinned `public cpu` image, has no secrets, records exact seed/step budgets and
source SHA, and uploads the reproducible failure log.
`llama-upstream-canary.yml` runs daily or on trusted-main dispatch. It freezes
one main source SHA and the upstream target before any hardware work. Unchanged
scheduled/forced runs build once and certify the complete roster. Changed pins
use up to three repair attempts, each followed (only when all families pass) by
an independent build and complete verification pass on the exact same commit.


Manual `mesh_ref` dispatches accept an explicitly trusted same-repository branch
or full commit SHA. Resolution freezes the SHA once, requires it to be reachable
from a repository branch, and reads its existing llama.cpp pin. `upstream_sha`
cannot be combined with this input. Keep the Actions workflow ref on `main`;
selecting `mesh_ref` always runs a complete certify-only pass, without Goose,
source repair, an independent upgrade-verification pass, or PR publication.
The main controller, handoff validation, and aggregation remain at the workflow
revision; the canonical planner, source build scripts, and battery run from a
separate checkout of the selected SHA. The controller sorts only the scheduling
matrix, leaving the source-owned canonical plan unchanged. The package binds both revisions, and workers
reject any changed source identity. This is an operator-authorized trusted-code
path on persistent lab machines, not isolation for untrusted PRs or fork code.
Leaving `mesh_ref` empty preserves scheduled and upstream-upgrade behavior.

To certify a recovered branch after this workflow is on main:

```sh
gh workflow run llama-upstream-canary.yml --ref main \
  -f mesh_ref=scammed/recover-llama-pin-35582541955
```

The run summary records the resolved MeshLLM SHA and existing llama.cpp pin;
a branch moving later cannot change the selected source for that run.

`llama-canary-family-pass.yml` owns the reusable build → family matrix → hosted
aggregate. The producer performs prepare, manifest-policy, full native and Rust
builds, generated-family validation, smoke, and split-roster checks. It validates
the immutable HF cache before compilation and exports a candidate Git bundle,
one-family-per-shard plan, four arm64 certification binaries, a prebuilt
multimodal library-test executable, and the run-scoped CPU workload oracle
closure built by `just skippy-workload-oracles-build`. Static Metal resources
are embedded; an unpackaged non-system dylib makes the handoff fail. SHA-256
digests bind all handoff bytes to the candidate, main base, run/attempt, and
pass identity.

Before compilation, the controller runs the selected battery in cache-free
`--dry-run --skip-build` mode against its own planner output. This checks the
actual producer/consumer plan contract, including older planner order and
source-relative manifest paths. Handoff schema 3 also carries a digest-bound,
one-commit prepared llama.cpp bundle and preparation markers. Workers restore
and verify that source against the selected pin and patch queue before lanes
start; they cannot accidentally depend on a previous runner checkout.
The agent supervisor terminates remaining process-group members after normal
completion and waits for live members to stop before handing the workspace back.
Repair snapshots first verify the workload producer against the dirty source,
then bind its unchanged files to the identical committed candidate tree.
Pinned and independent verification builds keep their original source identity.

The family matrix is submitted in ascending estimated model bytes, with family
name breaking ties. Balanced shard membership remains unchanged. This puts
small models first in the canary's one-family-per-job matrix; parallel runner
availability can still change actual start and completion order.

Partial reruns reuse the successful producer's exact identity digest from the
same workflow run, retaining its original attempt. Family artifacts include
that digest and their worker attempt; aggregation downloads all attempts for
that identity and pass, then selects the latest receipt per family. Newer
failures supersede older successes; duplicate same-attempt receipts, missing
families, foreign identities, and out-of-range attempts fail closed. The matrix
job-result gate also rejects failed/cancelled jobs whose receipts never upload.
Rebuilt producers have distinct identities and cannot reuse old receipts.
Failed certifications upload their evidence and then fail the family job, so
GitHub's failed-job rerun can select them instead of only retrying aggregation.
Repair feedback includes attempt-labelled family/build history across reruns;
these diagnostics never substitute for either complete certification pass.

`scripts/plan-family-battery.py` validates the versioned JSON family policy
before native compilation: the three core parity lanes for certified causal
rows, and a class-specific smoke plus independent local-monolithic oracle pair
for each of the six registry-generated non-chat rows (`embedding`, `rerank`,
`encoder_decoder`, `ocr`, `speech_synthesis`, `speech_recognition`), each
paired with its `-oracle` lane. Every family row declares its workload `class`
and GGUF `architecture` separately; only causal rows with complete split-parity
policy contribute to the architecture admission roster, and every row's
immutable revisions/files must resolve in the verified read-only lab cache.
Workload readiness uses the planned per-model deadline for both servers;
embedding certification additionally requires the official Python SDK smoke.
Dry-run planning needs no oracle tools; a missing execution prerequisite
records failed lanes without discarding later family results.

Both the repair and independent verification candidate gates run the System One
(OpenJEV) smoke, `scripts/skippy-system-one-smoke.sh`, which drives
`POST /systemone` through the pinned `family-qwen3-dense` fixture for the
backend-independent contract and fail-closed rejections, and through the pinned
`unsloth/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-GGUF` Q4_K_M artifact for one complete
single-lane read with repeat/interleaved determinism. Both artifacts come from
`ci/model-artifacts/manifests/skippy-system-one-smoke.json`, whose cadence
authorization and pinned revision/size/SHA-256 are enforced before load; a
mismatch is a hard failure, never a skip. On a backend declared qualified
(default `cuda`), a missing pinned artifact is a hard failure rather than an
unqualified pass. The complete-model read is admitted only on a declared
qualified backend, so on the Metal runner it reports NOT CERTIFIED through the
build job summary and the uploaded `llama-canary-system-one-*` artifact rather
than passing quietly, and a red contract part or a red declared-qualified read
fails the producer gate, the changed-pin repair gates, and the independent
verification pass. It adds no family roster row and claims no split or profile
support.

Each named family job runs `--skip-build --shard-index` on the matching
`family-certify` pool, with max-parallel 8 and fail-fast disabled. Workers
restore the executable handoff, including the workload oracle closure, and
point the battery's `SKIPPY_WORKLOAD_*` variables at the restored closure; its
source- and executable-bound `producer.json` is re-verified before consumption,
so no worker compiles or downloads. No build runner is held while workers
queue: one machine can execute all jobs serially, and more machines can run
them concurrently. Each machine must have the same arm64/Metal
toolchain/runtime compatibility and an existing readable HF cache.
The shared `use-canary-cache` action loads the runner account's interactive login
shell for both producer and family jobs. It uses `HF_HOME` (falling back to legacy
`HF_CACHE` or the standard user cache), validates its `hub` directory and any
explicit `HF_HUB_CACHE`, and exports the resolved paths for the planner. A missing
mount fails with its actual path; the workflow never creates or seeds a model
cache. Existing `HF_TOKEN`/`HF_TOKEN_PATH` configuration is preserved, with tokens
masked before export. `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` is applied as certification policy rather
than required in the machine environment. Compiler-cache and local-tool defaults
use the runner account's home directory instead of a fixed username. Runner
services sharing a physical certification machine serialize model loads through
a pre-provisioned cross-account host lock in the root-owned
`/Library/Application Support/MeshLLM/locks` directory.
Certification endpoints use distinct OS-assigned loopback ports selected when
each lane starts. An address-in-use startup failure receives at most two retries
with newly selected ports; other startup errors fail immediately. The environment
preflight owns disk headroom only. There is no
Actions model cache.

The aggregate requires every planned family exactly once, successful worker
status, matching candidate/plan/build digests, and each family's required
lanes from the plan — split-parity lanes for causal rows, class-specific smoke
plus oracle lanes for the non-chat rows — plus any required multimodal result,
so the non-chat rows are hard gates on every certified run. The battery itself
reconciles the production planner's selected cuts, immutable revisions, tensor
bytes, and native MTP requirements. Native-head rows additionally require the
`native-mtp-heads` lane: all metadata-declared heads must produce proposals, and
target decoding at each proposal prefix must match an independent MTP-disabled
baseline. Rejected proposals are valid; omitted heads and state divergence fail.
Cache preflight checks the immutable GGUF head count against the declared count.
The pinned roster has one head each for GLM-4.5-Air and Nemotron and three for
MiMo2. Missing, cancelled, duplicate, or stale evidence cannot certify.
Native-head certification budgets include two additional startup allowances
for the integrated model and independent baseline loads, retaining the existing
absolute timeout cap. Dry-run planning reflects the declared native-head lane;
actual execution still requires the immutable metadata and tensor scans.

Aggregation reports every failed receipt, including its runner and outcome, in
the job log and Actions summary before rejecting the pass. Worker/aggregate
failures remain recoverable by later bounded repair passes; only complete
independent success permits publication.
Full worker/build logs remain for 14 days; executable handoffs remain for seven
days so a single-machine queue can complete later passes.

Within a build job, Goose resumes the same session for prepare/build failures
under the existing 11.5-hour coding-admission and 12-hour per-gate budgets. A
failed distributed pass supplies its candidate plus family/build logs to a new
session in the next bounded attempt. Candidates are local, uncertified commits
until both full family passes are green. The separate GitHub-hosted publisher
alone receives `CANARY_REPAIR_TOKEN`; it publishes no failed/incomplete state.
No Actions-write credential or dispatch controller is needed. Feature-ref
manual dispatch is rejected before persistent-runner work. The workflow-level
non-cancelling concurrency group serializes canary runs, not individual families.

For a non-canary manual dispatch, `release.yml` runs the checked-in
`scripts/release-version.sh`, creates one linear release-source commit when the
tracked version surface changes, and fast-forwards `main` before any release
build starts. `just release` is a preflight and synchronous dispatcher for that
same workflow. Canary dispatches never update `main` or publish. Release tags
and releases are immutable on the manual release path: a non-canary dispatch
refuses an already-existing tag and fails closed if it cannot verify the
remote tag state. The release workflow is dispatch-only, so re-pushing a tag
does not start a second release pipeline or silently serve rebuilt bytes (for
example a different glibc floor) under the same version. The publish job
creates only the release-specific tag commit
for generated Swift/SDK resources and enables GitHub-generated release notes.
The comparison base is the highest stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag below the
target; prerelease tags are excluded so RC and final notes use the same stable
baseline.

The `release_notes` job runs after a successful stable publish with
`contents: write` and regroups that published body into Keep a Changelog
sections through `scripts/release-notes-generate.sh`. The deterministic
classifier maps Conventional Commits types from the canonical commit range; the
optional agent review pass runs only when `RELEASE_NOTES_AGENT_MODEL` is set,
the agent CLI is installed, credentials exist, and a bounded liveness probe
succeeds. The agent turn runs with `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` stripped and
never publishes. Any agent failure keeps the deterministic notes without
failing the job. Evidence uploads as `release-notes-<tag>` for 90 days.

Merge settings as of 2026-09-10: `allow_merge_commit=false`,
`allow_rebase_merge=true`, `allow_squash_merge=true`,
`squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE`, and
`squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY`. The title and body settings were
changed from `COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE` and `COMMIT_MESSAGES` on that date.
`COMMIT_MESSAGES` composed the squash body from the branch commit messages,
which carried agent and bot `Co-authored-by:` trailers onto `main` even when
the pull request title was clean. Composing from the title and body instead
means the squash commit contains only text CI has validated. GitHub may still
add its own `Co-authored-by:` trailer for a pull request whose commits have
several distinct authors; no message-level control prevents that.

Attribution-trailer enforcement is CI plus merge-message composition, not a
ruleset. A negated `commit_message_pattern` ruleset was created, measured and
deleted on 2026-09-10. Rulesets accept commit-metadata rules on any plan and
report them `active`, but GitHub gates metadata restrictions to Enterprise
organizations and this organization is on Team, so the rule was never
evaluated. Four pushes carrying the denied literal were accepted: branch
creation and branch update, with both the `regex` and `contains` operators,
from a ruleset reporting `current_user_can_bypass: "never"`. Do not re-add a
commit-metadata rule here expecting it to enforce anything.

What enforces the convention instead:

- `scripts/hooks/commit-msg` locally, installed by `just hooks-install` and by
  the first local development build on every platform.
- The `commit_convention` job in `ci-quality-slice.yml`, which validates the
  pull request title against Conventional Commits and scans every branch
  commit message plus the pull request body for denied attribution trailers.
  It declares no `needs`, so it fails within a minute rather than after a lane
  has compiled anything, and runs only for `pull_request` events.
  Pull-request-authored text reaches the script through environment variables
  and is never interpolated into the shell.
- Merge-message composition. `squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE` and
  `squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY` since 2026-09-10, replacing
  `COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE` and `COMMIT_MESSAGES`. The squash commit is built from
  the title and body that CI validated, so a branch commit that skipped the
  hook cannot carry a trailer onto `main`.

The four `main` ruleset bypass actors remain deliberately: maintainers need a
fast merge path. Required checks therefore do not bind them, and the CI check
is the control for everyone else.

The five PR lifecycle rows and five main push rows above are the complete
allowed routine required-validation entry sets. `pr_ci_canary.yml` is an
explicit optional diagnostic exception, not a required check and not part of
the sibling monitor's five-workflow target list. It calls the protected
`main`-owned reusable lane, which uses the pull-request merge SHA as the built
source while retaining the PR head SHA as separate identity evidence. Its
runner-policy jobs leave `policy_source_sha` unset and therefore use the
protected default branch. The canary owns
one fixed Linux amd64 CPU chain
(UI artifact, release host, native runtime, and product composition), uses
read-only contents/packages permissions and a plain step summary, and does not
run the all-platform Linux lane. It has no secrets, environments, OIDC, Depot,
or persistent self-hosted runner. Hosted placement is containment, not a
security boundary against edited PR YAML or actions; any future rollout still
requires restricting persistent runner groups to protected main-owned workflow
references. The protected sibling monitor is metadata/control infrastructure,
not a sixth required validation entrypoint. Their separation and direct GitHub
log visibility are contractual, not a presentation preference. The retained
`ci.yml` is reusable-only migration scaffolding and must never regain event
triggers or call the five lanes; remove it after the protected-main
runner-contract update is active.

### Desktop installers

`desktop-packages.yml` packages the Tauri app in `desktop/` around an already
published stable release; it never compiles mesh-llm. `resolve` rejects tags
outside `^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` (MSI versions cannot carry prerelease
suffixes) and confirms the release exists. The `package` matrix runs on fixed
GitHub-hosted `macos-15` (aarch64 Metal, `.dmg`) and `windows-2022` (x86_64 CPU,
`.msi` + NSIS `.exe`) runners without `select-ci-runners`. Each row downloads the
release archive and its `.sha256` sidecar, verifies and safely unpacks it with
`scripts/unpack-release-product.py`, and stages the exact host and runtime bytes
with `scripts/stage-desktop-sidecar.{sh,ps1}`. The Tauri CLI comes from
`desktop/package-lock.json` via `npm ci`. sccache is initialized job-local with
both remote-cache inputs `"false"`, and macOS uses
`scripts/lib/macos-deployment-target.txt`. Installers are renamed
`mesh-llm-desktop-<version>-<target>` with `.sha256` sidecars and uploaded for 14
days. Top-level permissions are `contents: read`; only `attach` holds
`contents: write`, and it runs only when `attach_to_release` is true on the
default branch and every package row succeeded. No signing secrets are used, so
installers are unsigned. Tauri's Windows bundler downloads its own pinned WiX
and NSIS toolsets during `tauri build`. Linux (`.deb`/`.AppImage`) is deferred:
Tauri needs webkit2gtk system packages, which belong in `mesh-llm-runner-images`
rather than a job-level `apt` step. `scripts/tests/test_desktop_packages_workflow.py`
pins these properties.

## Reusable workflows and slices

| Workflow | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `ci-quality-lane.yml` | Quality and runner/cache contract graph; reusable from PRs and dispatchable for main/manual |
| `ci-website-lane.yml` | Console and website graph; reusable from PRs and dispatchable for main/manual |
| `ci-linux-lane.yml` | Linux host/runtime/product/Rust/SDK/smoke graph with one platform-local UI producer |
| `ci-macos-lane.yml` | macOS host/runtime/product/platform/Swift/Metal graph with one platform-local UI producer |
| `ci-windows-lane.yml` | Windows host/runtime/product/platform graph with one platform-local UI producer |
| `ci-pr-canary-lane.yml` | Optional protected merge-source diagnostic lane for one Linux amd64 CPU UI/host/runtime/product chain; runner policy stays on the default branch, and the summary is step-summary-only and non-required |
| `ci-quality-slice.yml` | Contracts, format, unused-dependency check, Clippy and generated CLI inventory freshness; additive protected authority sentinel |
| `ci-web-slice.yml` | Console quality, console Playwright E2E, public website build, and CLI explorer browser validation |
| `ci-ui-artifact-slice.yml` | Immutable console distribution producer; release callers prepare one source/version-bound UI with complete file checksums, shared by all hosts and SDK resources |
| `static-abi-artifact.yml` | Typed static llama ABI producer with internal runner policy and an exact toolchain-epoch output |
| `ci-rust-tests-slice.yml` | Typed deterministic Cargo test batches that verify the producer-owned static ABI toolchain epoch and a pinned, digest-verified Skippy correctness fixture; related PR changes additionally compile one asserted, fully qualified runtime test and smoke an immutable SmolLM2 SafeTensors checkpoint through the complete Mesh config/resolver/server/native path to sampled prefill and decode with every supported load-time quantization |
| `ci-{linux,macos,windows}-host-slice.yml` | Platform-pure neutral host producers; no empty cross-platform jobs |
| `ci-{linux,macos,windows}-runtime-slice.yml` | Platform-pure native runtime producers. The Linux CPU row also runs the native runtime-event gate against the runtime it just built and uploads its evidence. |
| `ci-{linux,macos,windows}-product-slice.yml` | Platform-pure composition-only product consumers |
| `ci-platform-checks-slice.yml` | macOS portable/unit, Windows portable/unit, and Windows log-store privacy ACL checks |
| `ci-linux-product-smoke-slice.yml`, `ci-macos-product-smoke-slice.yml` | Platform-local core, scripted, and model-download smokes. Core CPU/CUDA/Metal restores the registry-pinned SmolLM2 Q8 and IBM Granite 4.0 H Q4 pair once and runs both through standalone inference, OpenAI client compatibility, and constrained-Tokio restart. The CPU two-node split row uses the same pair for dense KV and strict recurrent `KvRecurrent` validation, persists strict-whitelist seed/worker identity and stage/model snapshots, reconciles two-observer topology and exact two-stage contiguous-cut agreement, and uploads evidence on every outcome. The Linux CPU row additionally preserves node cache roots across restart and requires an observable durable-L3 fill before status and clear verification. Product restore verifies the manifest backend and forces discovery through the bundled runtime. CUDA verifies the packaged dependency closure with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` unset, runs inherited and strict device probes, installs no cudart or cuBLAS packages, and leaves the NVIDIA driver host-owned. There is no separate product-integration or Qwen migration lane. |
| `ci-linux-sdk-slice.yml`, `ci-macos-sdk-slice.yml` | Platform-local Rust/Kotlin/Swift smoke consumers; SDK producers are independent top-level calls and each smoke receives the lane-local immutable UI artifact |
| `ci-runner-contract-slice.yml` | Provider/cache/plan trust and main runner-image checks |
| `native-sdk-artifact.yml` | Typed native SDK producer |
| `swift-sdk-artifact.yml` | Host-only/full XCFramework producer; full mode builds the seven Apple Rust targets as a bounded matrix (maximum four concurrent macOS runners) and joins their immutable libraries in one assembly job, while host-only remains a single producer. Trusted main remains `macos-15`, while eligible same-repository PRs follow the protected Depot macOS 15 gate |
| `smoke.yml` | Artifact-based inference/OpenAI/split smoke |
| `scripted-binary-smoke.yml` | Artifact-based scripted product smoke with optional typed model context-size and recurrent-model inputs; recurrent models restore and save through a dedicated trust-scoped cache before the smoke runs |
| `sdk-smoke.yml` | Artifact-based SDK consumers; all SDK rows consume the lane's immutable console UI artifact, while Rust smoke restores the main-seeded, target/profile/image/toolchain/recipe-bound Cargo/target cache through `Swatinem/rust-cache` |
| `hf-download-smoke.yml` | Hugging Face download smoke |

All workflow calls use typed, bounded semantic inputs. Credential-bearing smoke
workflows remain fixed to GitHub-hosted runners; the PR entrypoints pass no
repository secrets. The trusted main entrypoint may pass the optional
`HF_TOKEN` for public-fixture rate-limit resilience.

## Prebuilt runner-image containerization

`ci/runner-images.json` records the checked-in image references, semantic job
bindings, native epochs, compiler-seed identity and the separate SDK Rust
toolchain identity. `scripts/runner-image-identity.py check` compares those
values with every literal workflow image binding and the actual planner rows.
Its focused tests run through the existing `just ci-validate` discovery. This
catalog adds no planner authority and changes no cache keys.
Historical receipt, provenance and workload-coverage fields are explicitly
unknown. `diagnose` reports deliberate runtime seed exclusion;
matching image identity does not qualify the host seed for native runtime work.

Some CI jobs run inside a `container:` pinned to a digest from the
`mesh-llm-runner-images` repo instead of installing tooling per-run with
`actions/setup-*`. There is no separate sister repo: the `public web`
backend (baked Chromium/Playwright) lives on `mesh-llm-runner-images` main
alongside every other family, added by `17283ab` (#20, the `public web`
backend) and `5ea673b` (#21, the Playwright version assert). The GHCR
package name
`ghcr.io/mesh-llm/mesh-llm-cuda-runner` is legacy: it hosts every backend
family (`public cpu`, `public cuda`, `public rocm`, `public vulkan`,
`public web`, `public ui`, `public browser`, `self-hosted`), not only CUDA. Full native/web images bake
`cargo cmake docker git jq just lld node ninja npm pnpm python rustc sccache`
(asserted by `verify-runner-image`, see below) plus a Python venv on `PATH`
(`VIRTUAL_ENV=/opt/mesh-llm/venv`), pinned pnpm/node (`PNPM_HOME`,
`CARGO_HOME`, `RUSTUP_HOME` baked as ENV so they resolve the same regardless
of the container's `HOME`), and, for the `public` stage only, runs as
**root** (`USER root`, never dropped back) rather than `runner` --
`self-hosted` is the only stage that ends `USER runner`.

Reusable slices/workflows with a `container:` job, and what backs it:

| Workflow | Job(s) | Image family |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci-{linux}-host-slice.yml`, `ci-linux-runtime-slice.yml`, `ci-linux-product-slice.yml`, `ci-rust-tests-slice.yml`, `ci-quality-slice.yml` (Clippy batches) | matrix-selected | `public cpu` (pre-existing, predates this containerization pass) |
| `native-sdk-artifact.yml`, `node-sdk-addon-artifact.yml`, `static-abi-artifact.yml`, `swift-sdk-artifact.yml` | producer job | `public cpu` (pre-existing) |
| `hf-download-smoke.yml`, `scripted-binary-smoke.yml` | their single job | `public cpu`, sha256:8d93de6b... -- unconditional, no bare-metal row |
| `smoke.yml` | `smoke_tests` | `public cpu` when `inputs.runner != 'gpu-nvidia'`, else uncontainerized (see opt-out below) |
| `sdk-smoke.yml` | its job | `public cpu` when `inputs.sdk_kind != 'swift'`, else uncontainerized |
| `ci-ui-artifact-slice.yml` | `ui_artifact` | `public ui` ordinarily; existing `public web` for nonempty release tags |
| `ci-web-slice.yml` | `ui_quality`, `ui_e2e`, `website` | `public ui`, `public browser`, existing `public web`, respectively |
| `website-pages.yml` | `build` | `public web` |
| `nightly-stability-run.yml` | `stability` | `public web` (bakes node/pnpm the CLI-smoke step needs) |
| `nightly-kv-coverage.yml` | `ownership-state-machines` | `public cpu`, sha256:8d93de6b... |
| `release.yml` (CUDA/ROCm/Vulkan compiler rows) | per-backend `public` digests | Native compiler/toolkit images remain backend-specific; amd64 CUDA preserves its intentional ARC self-hosted placement |
| `release.yml` (Linux CUDA/ROCm/Vulkan composition rows) | `public cpu`, sha256:8d93de6b... | Verify, compose, readiness-test and archive exact producer bytes without downloading a compiler toolkit |

`public cpu` and `public web` are separate image builds (the latter adds
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/ms-playwright`,
`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`, and a stamped
`/etc/mesh-runner-playwright-version`); do not assume one digest covers both.

### `image: ''` opt-out rows

`smoke.yml`'s `gpu-nvidia` row (the approved uncredentialed self-hosted CUDA
smoke exception) and `sdk-smoke.yml`'s `swift` row (host-only macOS SDK
build, `macos-15`, never container-capable) opt out per-run with
`image: ''` rather than being a separate job, so the rest of the job body
(steps, `if: job.container.id == ''` gates) stays shared. This is proven to
actually opt a job out of containerization by two runs on the temporary
branch-head harness used to validate #1380 (run 32349670919, jobs
96370649138 `CUDA inference smoke` and 96375145155 `swift SDK Smoke`): no
`Initialize containers` log group, no `docker create`, and the gated
`actions/setup-python`/`pnpm/action-setup` steps ran. There is no other
empty-image job anywhere in this repo's workflow history.

The ternary that selects `image: ''` must put the **non-empty** value in the
`&&` branch: `cond && url || ''`, never `cond && '' || url`. GitHub Actions
expressions are JS-style short-circuit and `''` is falsy, so
`cond && '' || url` always evaluates to `url` regardless of `cond` -- the
opt-out branch becomes unreachable. `scripts/tests/test_ci_workflow_ternary_contract.py`
fails any `${{ }}` ternary whose `&&` branch is a falsy literal (`''`, `""`,
`0`, `false`) across every workflow; it exists specifically because this bug
class is invisible to `actionlint`.

### `job.container.id == ''` gating

When a job has both a containerized and a bare-metal row, setup actions needed
only by the bare-metal row are gated `if: job.container.id == ''` rather than
allowed to shadow tools from the image. `sdk-smoke.yml`'s bare-metal Swift row
consumes the immutable UI artifact with `--skip-build`, so it needs neither
Node nor pnpm; those setup actions and their unused package cache are absent.
Its smoke script temporarily creates the legacy protected-main workflow's
computed pnpm store when that older workflow installed pnpm, preventing the
setup-node post-job cache hook from failing before this workflow change lands
on `main`. **Deliberate exception: `actions/setup-java` in
`sdk-smoke.yml` is never gated.** `verify-runner-image`'s asserted tool list
has no JDK, so the image provides nothing for it to shadow; gating it would
break the Kotlin SDK smoke on the containerized row instead of protecting it.
Jobs with no bare-metal row at all (the `ci-web-slice.yml` / `website-pages.yml`
/ `ci-ui-artifact-slice.yml` / `nightly-stability-run.yml` set) delete the
now-redundant setup actions outright instead of gating them -- there is
nothing for the `if:` to select between.

`npm install --global openai` in `smoke.yml` is **not** gated on
`job.container.id`, even though `install-core-tools.sh:83` bakes an
exact-pinned `openai` into the image on `mesh-llm-runner-images` main. The
`public cpu` digest pinned in `ci/slices.yml` predates that bake (see
"A pinned digest is a frozen artifact" below), so the containerized row needs
the install too, and the step runs unconditionally for both it and the
bare-metal `gpu-nvidia` row. Re-gate it only once the CPU digest is promoted
past `mesh-llm-runner-images` #20 and that is confirmed from a green run.

Both call sites install `openai@7.5.0`, not floating `openai`. The step runs
with the full job environment (`HF_TOKEN` included) and npm lifecycle scripts
inherit it, so an unreviewed upstream release must not be able to execute
there; `zizmor`'s `adhoc-packages` rule flags the floating form. The version
deliberately tracks the image's own `ARG OPENAI_NPM_VERSION`
(`mesh-llm-runner-images` `Dockerfile:25`) so that re-gating the step later is
a no-op rather than a version swap -- bump both sides together.

### Container jobs default `run:` to `sh`, not `bash`

Jobs with a `container:` block resolve the default `run:` shell to
`sh -e {0}`, not `bash -e {0}` (bare-metal Linux/macOS runners default to
bash; this only changes inside a container). Composite actions are
unaffected -- they declare their own shell. Any `run:` step in a
containerized job that uses a bashism (`<<<`, `set -o pipefail`, `[[`,
array assignment, `${v//}`/`${v^^}`/`${v,,}`, `&>`, `source`, `+=(`, ...)
must declare `shell: bash` explicitly or it fails at runtime with a
`dash`/`sh` syntax error that `actionlint` cannot catch -- its shellcheck
integration assumes bash. Two sites hit this in the same PR:
`ci-web-slice.yml`'s `ui_e2e` preflight (`<<<`) and
`website-pages.yml`'s `Stage Pages artifact` (`set -euo pipefail`); both now
declare `shell: bash`.

`$(( ))` arithmetic expansion is **not** on that list and must not be added.
It is POSIX (Shell Command Language 2.6.4) and `dash` evaluates it correctly;
flagging it would reject valid `sh` steps and force a spurious `shell: bash`.
`scripts/tests/test_ci_workflow_container_shell_contract.py` carries the
pattern list and an inline note saying so.

### Reusable-workflow permission chain

A called reusable workflow may not request a permission scope its caller job
does not grant; GitHub rejects at run creation with a **zero-job
`startup_failure`** -- no jobs, no logs, no check run on the commit, and
`actionlint` cannot see it. Containerizing surfaced this because
`packages: read` (needed to pull the private GHCR runner images) has to be
granted at *every* hop, and
`ci-linux-product-smoke-slice.yml` / `ci-macos-product-smoke-slice.yml` sat at
`contents: read` between granted parents and requesting children.
`scripts/tests/test_ci_workflow_permission_contract.py` walks every local
`uses: ./.github/workflows/X.yml` edge and asserts the caller's effective
permissions (job-level, else workflow-level) cover what `X.yml` requests.

Two properties make that assertion real rather than decorative, and both were
absent when the test was first written:

1. **The callee's requested set is the workflow-level block merged with every
   explicit job-level block.** Five reusable workflows here
   (`native-sdk-artifact.yml`, `node-sdk-addon-artifact.yml`, `sdk-smoke.yml`,
   `static-abi-artifact.yml`, `swift-sdk-artifact.yml`) declare permissions
   only at job level, so reading the workflow-level block alone returns `None`
   for them and skips their caller edges entirely -- including the
   `packages: read` edges this test exists to cover.
2. **Scope levels are compared, not scope names.** `contents: read` does not
   satisfy a callee's `contents: write`; GitHub rejects that downgrade at run
   creation exactly like a missing scope. The comparison ranks
   `none < read < write`, and where a scope is declared in more than one block
   the strictest level wins. A name-only set comparison silently passes the
   downgrade.

3. **`read-all`/`write-all` are modelled on the granting side, not skipped.**
   As a *grant* they are perfectly enumerable -- `write-all` satisfies any
   request, `read-all` satisfies a `read` request but not a `write` one -- so
   returning "unknown" and skipping the edge would hide the same
   run-creation failure. As a *request* they stay opaque: a callee asking
   `write-all` names no scopes to hold its caller to, and asserting there
   would be invention rather than checking.
4. **Both workflow extensions are read.** Globbing `*.yml` alone would skip a
   `*.yaml` callee entirely; the repo has none today, which is exactly when
   that gap is cheapest to close.

None of these were breakages -- the repo satisfies the contract at every edge
under the strict check, and it has no `.yaml` workflows or all-scope grants at
all. That is the point: a permission test that under-reads its inputs reports
green for edges it never examined, and each of these was found by tightening
the test rather than by anything failing.

### `verify-runner-image` preflight

Containerized jobs run `verify-runner-image <environment> <backend> ...`
(positional args: environment, backend, mesh-llm revision, CUDA series, ROCm
version, runner-images revision, and -- browser/web images -- expected
Playwright version, added in `mesh-llm-runner-images`#21) before doing real
work, asserting `/etc/mesh-runner-*` files match what the job expects rather
than trusting the digest pin alone. `ci-web-slice.yml`'s `ui_e2e` job
resolves the installed `@playwright/test` version with
`pnpm exec playwright --version | head -n1 | awk '{print $NF}'` (guarded by a
`^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` shape assertion -- `playwright --version` can share
stdout with an npm warning) and passes it as the seventh argument; a mismatch
against the image's own build-time `playwright --version` fails fast instead
of surfacing as a confusing Playwright/Chromium error deep in the E2E run.

`crates/mesh-llm-ui/package.json`'s `@playwright/test` and
`mesh-llm-runner-images`' `config/playwright-pin.txt` are now a matched pair
(both `1.62.1` as of 2026-08-20; re-check the two sources rather than
trusting this line). Bumping the mesh-llm side alone fails `ui_e2e` on
**every** PR at this preflight, not just locally. The bump is a four-step
cross-repo sequence, in order: bump `config/playwright-pin.txt` in
`mesh-llm-runner-images`, rebuild and promote the `public web` image, re-pin
the new digest in `ci-web-slice.yml` (and `ci-ui-artifact-slice.yml` /
`website-pages.yml` / `nightly-stability-run.yml`, which share it), then
bump `@playwright/test` in `crates/mesh-llm-ui/package.json`.

### `setup-macos-lld` composite

`.github/actions/setup-macos-lld` installs lld through Homebrew, adds its
resolved bin directory to the job path, and invokes the checked-in
`scripts/cargo-linker` probe. It does not export Rust flags. The repository
Cargo config owns every later link, so Android target flags and caller flags
continue to compose normally. Seven call sites:
`ci-platform-checks-slice.yml`, `ci-macos-host-slice.yml`,
`swift-sdk-artifact.yml`, `native-sdk-artifact.yml`,
`node-sdk-addon-artifact.yml`, and two in `release.yml`.

### A pinned digest is a frozen artifact

`mesh-llm-runner-images` HEAD says nothing about what is inside the digest a
workflow pins -- the `public cpu` digest pinned in `ci/slices.yml` was built
2026-07-22 and does not contain changes merged to that repo afterwards
(the `smoke.yml` openai bake landed a week later, in #20). Before deleting or
gating a dependency install on the grounds that "the image bakes it,"
confirm the capability exists **in the pinned digest**, and confirm it from a
green run of the job that needs it. `verify-runner-image`'s JSON is the
cheap probe: `mesh_llm_revision` dates the build, and missing keys (added to
the asserted object in later `mesh-llm-runner-images` commits) date the
baked verify script itself.

### Digest promotion

`build-and-push.yml` (in `mesh-llm-runner-images`) runs `stage_families` for
both `operation=stage` and `operation=promote`; `promote_versioned` reads the
candidate descriptor artifact from that **same run**, not from an earlier
stage run. A `promote` dispatch therefore re-stages and promotes its own
build. Read the digest to pin from the promote job's own `digest=` output
(e.g. `promoted ghcr.io/... -> sha256:...` in its log) -- never carry forward
a digest observed from an earlier stage-only run, even one at the same
source commit.

## Planner contract

- `scripts/plan-ci.py` is the only routing implementation.
- `ci/ownership.yml` maps paths and direct crates to semantic domains; unknown
  paths fail closed.
- `ci/slices.yml` defines profiles, slice dependencies, rows, runner roles,
  cache modes and worker budgets.
- `ci/ci-plan.schema.json` versions the machine-readable output.
- `compute-changes` supplies the complete event diff and affected Cargo
  closure; the planner owns signals and final matrix selection.
- Each `pr_*.yml` workflow checks out the default branch for canonical planning,
  projects one bounded lane, and calls its matching default-branch lane as a
  nested reusable workflow. The protected planner action extracts only
  `ci/ownership.yml` and `ci/slices.yml` from the validated immutable PR source
  SHA into a unique runner-temp directory. It treats those manifests as data;
  both source catalogs must match the protected catalogs before use, so PRs
  cannot alter ownership or expand protected matrix or worker ceilings.
  planner code, Cargo workspace discovery, and affected-crate operations remain
  rooted in the protected checkout. Missing or non-regular source manifests
  fail planning. Jobs and logs remain attached to five focused PR runs rather
  than one monolithic graph.
- The optional `pr_ci_canary.yml` runs the planner/action contract from the
  merge-source checkout as a diagnostic, while comparing the merge catalogs to
  the pull-request base and refusing catalog drift. Its fixed graph does not
  consume planner-selected matrices. Its runner-policy jobs leave
  `policy_source_sha` unset and therefore use the protected default branch, as
  do the ordinary four slice callers unless they pass an explicit policy
  revision.
- Catalog evolution is a sequenced maintainer merge. A branch that needs a new
  `ci/ownership.yml` or `ci/slices.yml` entry cannot pass its own Plan gate,
  because the byte-identical compare is the boundary keeping PR-controlled
  routing out of the protected planner. Land a catalog-only commit on the
  default branch first, then rebase the dependent branch onto it. Do not relax
  the compare, add a label-gated bypass, or special-case catalog paths.
- Each `main_*.yml` workflow plans the exhaustive main profile at the pushed
  SHA, projects one bounded lane, and calls its matching same-commit lane as a
  nested reusable workflow. Routine main jobs and logs therefore remain
  attached to five focused main runs.
- `ci-control.yml` is manual-full only. It calls the planner once and dispatches
  bounded JSON lane projections as native inputs for explicit operator
  diagnostics; it cannot receive a push, PR, or workflow-run event.

Main/manual profiles enumerate every workspace crate exactly once and all
supported product/SDK rows. Ready PR profiles select affected or directly owned
rows from that same catalog. Draft PR profiles select no build rows unless the
changed paths require the documented CI-control or runner-infrastructure
fail-open policy.

## Artifact and cache owners

Repository Cargo defaults require `sccache` and select a target-specific
linker driver. Full Linux runner images provide mold as the primary linker and
lld as the compatibility control. macOS jobs install lld through the shared
setup action; an installed ld64.lld that fails the active SDK/target probe
falls back to Apple ld. Windows resolves rust-lld or lld-link. The Unix probe
cache includes the linker, compiler, SDK, host and target-driver identity.

The persistent macOS llama canary keeps a stable arm64-only sccache directory
and adds an explicit C/C++ cache buster over architecture, backend, profile,
compiler/SDK identity and native recipe inputs. Its CMake build directory
remains run-unique, every staged archive is checked with `lipo`, and cache
statistics are retained in the job log. The nightly KV workflow no longer
clears the repository Rust wrapper. Every managed Windows compile job uses
sccache with short `C:\\s` and `C:\\t` roots, and every Windows native backend
asks CMake to hash object paths at 180 characters before the legacy MAX_PATH
boundary.

- `restore-release-ui` / `scripts/ui-distribution.py`: verify the shared release
  console's source SHA, version, complete file hashes and built JavaScript entry
  before platform-specific Rust compilation or SDK resource packaging. The
  UI producer's version step trusts only `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` in the container's
  active Git configuration before verifying the exact checkout SHA.
  The `prepared-release-ui-*` artifact retains for 90 days and is excluded from the
  GitHub release asset glob. Swift release resource assembly skips pnpm and the
  console build when this artifact is supplied; ordinary PR/main behavior is
  unchanged.

- `prepare-host-input` / `prepare-windows-host-input`: neutral host bytes,
  import report and checksum.
- `prepare-native-runtime-input`: one verified native runtime archive and
  manifest. Non-Windows artifacts include the checksum-bound
  `skippy-model-package` tool used by split-serving consumers to prepare
  package-v2 fixtures; Windows artifacts remain DLL-only until the producer has
  a reliable import-library path for the tool.
- `prepare-static-abi-input`: portable static ABI archive.
- `compose-product-input`: exact host/runtime verification and composition.
  Linux CPU readiness also feeds the composed host's real `runtime list
  --available --json` output through `ci-prepare-native-runtime.sh`, the shared
  SDK reader, with fallback building disabled. This covers CLI JSON changes
  even when full SDK rows are unselected; accelerator compatibility is not
  required on driverless composition workers.
- `ci/model-artifacts/registry.json`: canonical immutable model identities,
  integrity, family capability tags, and allowed general suite/cadence membership.
  `scripts/generate-test-model-manifests.py` owns the family battery and
  suite-specific projections; CI contract tests reject stale projections.
- The Linux CPU runtime-event gate consumes `family-qwen3-dense` from
  `skippy-ci-smoke.json` at pull-request, main, or manual cadence. The family
  battery has one complete roster without cadence filtering. The gate resolves its
  evidence output to an absolute path before Cargo starts, so the crate-local
  test writer and lane check use the same file.
- `restore-test-model`: the single implementation of model resolve, cache,
  download, and verify. Resolves generated suite manifests, uses exact
  digest-bearing cache keys, and stream-verifies size and SHA-256 before use.
  `model_artifact_id` selects one artifact from a multi-artifact manifest,
  and reaches both the resolve and the verify call so verification cannot
  check a different file than the one downloaded.
- `restore-smoke-inputs`: product extraction for consumers; delegates model
  restoration to `restore-test-model` rather than carrying a second copy of
  that sequence.
- `select-ci-runners`: provider labels, cache permissions, and the
  provider-derived `allow_native_github_cache` / `allow_depot_remote_cache`
  outputs. Depot selections disable both cache paths by default. During the
  bounded approved exception, eligible same-repository PR and trusted-main
  Depot jobs enable the GitHub Actions cache API while direct Depot remote
  cache remains disabled. Hosted PR, release, and cache-warmer selections
  retain native GitHub cache behavior.
- `configure-sccache-gha`: event/provider-derived compiler-cache setup.
- `restore-sccache-seed`: exact-key restore of the trusted 2 GiB Linux seed;
  central runner policy permits it only for GitHub-hosted selections, and
  native runtime restore is explicitly disabled after zero-reuse qualification.
- `capture-sccache-stats`: machine-readable cache evidence. Warm consumers with
  a positive floor fail when no cache requests are observable; the zero-floor
  SafeTensors observation remains non-failing and emits a wiring warning.

Rust-test batches that contain `skippy-runtime` or `skippy-model-package`
resolve the generated Skippy correctness manifest, then restore the pinned Qwen
fixture from one exact GitHub Actions cache key containing its file SHA-256 and
`.github/cache-version.txt`. Every use is verified against the pinned size and
digest before tests. The SafeTensors smoke resolves its repository, revision,
complete file set, per-file integrity, and quantization sweep from the same
registry. Cache publication is limited
to the exhaustive trusted-main batch containing `skippy-runtime`; PR jobs are
restore-only and jobs for which central runner policy denies native GitHub
cache access download and verify the immutable revision without publishing.

`scripts/collect-ci-metrics.py` is the read-only timing evidence collector. Its
schema-v3 report keeps workflow wall/queue, job runner queue, measured
dependency wait, job execution, runner-minutes, cancelled runner-minutes and
peak workers separate. It groups observations by provider, operating system,
architecture, semantic runner role and Depot size, and emits deterministic
queue/capacity heuristics plus an optional provider-cohort comparison. Raw
inputs and dated reports belong under `/tmp` or a tracking issue/artifact, not
under `ci/` or this inventory.

Artifacts are correctness boundaries; caches only accelerate regeneration.
PR artifacts generally retain for one day. Fork lanes cannot publish shared
trusted-main caches. Same-repository PRs normally use GitHub's ref-scoped cache;
eligible PR jobs may temporarily use Depot's shared cross-branch
namespace under `ci/DEPOT_PR_RISK_EXCEPTION.md`. That namespace is treated as
untrusted input, not an authority or correctness boundary. Linux Clippy,
Rust-test and host jobs restore one bounded trusted sccache seed
instead of per-row Cargo target archives. The protected warmer's
`just ci-sccache-seed-build` recipe covers the dominant `mesh-llm` Clippy graph
and the isolated `mesh-llm-cli` test graph used by the Rust-test matrix. Depot
selections cannot restore that
seed through their cross-trust cache proxy. Its exact key fingerprints the
warmer image and toolchain epoch. Native-runtime rows explicitly remain cold
after three verified warm samples observed zero reuse. These four high-fanout families disable per-object GHA
publication on every provider. Exact Linux static ABI, Swift ABI, macOS Metal unit ABI,
and Windows native ABI caches may publish into GitHub's isolated PR merge-ref
scope for same-PR reruns. UI installs (`ui_quality`, `ui_e2e`, `ui_artifact`) point pnpm at the runner
image's baked store instead of an Actions cache — there is no shared pnpm
key or publisher to race. Trusted main owns shared publication.

PR Rust-test, host, native-runtime, product, platform-check, and full Swift
target matrices receive `fail_fast: true`; main/manual and release pass
`false`. Quality matrices remain
non-fail-fast and failed producers suppress impossible consumers through
`needs`. One protected, default-branch `workflow_run` monitor starts with
`PR · Quality`, polls the five exact-PR/exact-SHA validation runs, preserves the
run containing the first definitive failed job, and cancels its queued or
in-progress siblings. It checks out only the default branch, owns the sole
`actions: write` token for this operation, and never targets main, manual,
release, deployment, cleanup, cache-warming, another PR event epoch, or a newer
revision. PR-controlled workflows and executor jobs retain no Actions-write
permission.

## Providers and variables

GitHub-hosted labels are `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-15`, and
`windows-2022`. Depot labels are selected only by `select-ci-runners`; no
workflow accepts a raw provider label. Trusted main Linux requires
`DEPOT_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`. Eligible same-repository PR jobs may use the
time-bounded exception when `DEPOT_PR_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`; it expires on
2026-09-14 UTC. Forks remain hosted. The intended permanent gate
may cover eligible build/test rows across Linux, Depot macOS 15 and Windows
2022 when equivalent images/architectures exist; planning/required summaries,
credential-bearing smokes, `gpu-nvidia` hardware and uncertified Intel macOS
rows remain exceptions. The documented `gpu-nvidia` ephemeral scale set is
the sole currently verified uncredentialed, hardware-qualified same-repository
PR exception. The typed ROCm job remains skipped unless
`MESH_ROCM_INFERENCE_RUNNER_ENABLED` explicitly enables the repository-scoped
`gpu-amd` role.

The permanent Depot PR gate is documented in `ci/DEPOT_MIGRATION.md`; the
accepted temporary findings and risks are in
`ci/DEPOT_PR_RISK_EXCEPTION.md`. Permanent activation requires cache
isolation, no PR cache/registry tokens, exact protected workflow refs,
ephemeral runners, a successful sentinel, and a tested GitHub rollback.

External administrative posture is now verified as follows: automatic Depot
Cache connectivity is disabled, automatic Registry Actions authentication is
disabled, and the Depot runner group is restricted to `Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm` and
the exact protected workflow refs. The repository token cannot independently
inspect organization runner-group settings through the API (403), so these
remain external facts rather than checked-in evidence. The two switches remove
Depot's direct `DEPOT_CACHE_TOKEN`/WebDAV build-tool preconfiguration and
Registry Actions authentication on fresh runners; they do not document or
enforce a per-connection/job/ref disable or ACL for the GitHub Actions cache
proxy/runtime-token path. The controlled
trusted-main seed [run 31816775585](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/actions/runs/31816775585)
succeeded at `main` commit `9e977e246`; the same-repository PR authority
sentinel [run 31816869128 / job 94821057215](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/actions/runs/31816869128/job/94821057215)
read and exactly validated the trusted seed, saved/cleared/restored and
exactly validated the poison, then failed its intended seed-isolation gate;
the enclosing PR run was later cancelled during cleanup. Trusted-main verify
[run 31817111471 / job 94821343605](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/actions/runs/31817111471/job/94821343605)
restored and exactly validated that poison, then failed its intended expected-
miss gate. This proves unsafe repository-scoped cross-trust authority, so it is
not a successful isolation result. The bounded exception knowingly accepts
that risk for eligible same-repository PRs to gain CI
iteration speed; it is not permanent-isolation evidence. The exact-SHA
five-lane candidate, provider comparison, and identical-SHA hosted rollback
are recorded in `.omo/specs/depot-pr-rollout-evidence.md`; Quality and Linux
had favorable queue observations but remain unclassified because execution
was cache-confounded, Website had insufficient samples, and macOS/Windows hit
the capacity rollback threshold. Fork PR validation and namespace purge/expiry
confirmation remain pending. Fork PR validation remains hosted and is the
no-Depot-authority half of the sentinel acceptance evidence; only the exact
same-repository sentinel ref may exercise the diagnostic Depot job. All three
sentinel cache phases attest the
provider-injected `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL`/`ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` structure before
invoking pinned `actions/cache` restore/save actions. The shell attestation
does not require ambient `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`: GitHub's
`NodeScriptActionHandler` injects that credential into the cache actions, while
the shell `ScriptHandler` does not. Successful full restore/save is the
credential/token proof. The non-loopback check includes all IPv4 `127/8`
and IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback spellings.
The protected PR probe clears and fully restores its saved poison key, requires
a cache hit and exact marker bytes before the trusted-seed gate, and thereby
proves the same-job Node token/write path; main verify's poison miss remains
the cross-scope proof.

The provider contract required before permanent PR placement is enabled is a documented,
server-enforced per-connection/job/ref control for the GitHub Actions cache
path. It must either leave PR jobs on GitHub-native branch-scoped
`ACTIONS_CACHE_URL`/`ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` and runtime-token semantics with no
Depot proxy or direct cache token, or issue a PR-isolated namespace/token whose
ACL permits reads and writes only within that PR, denying reads and writes from
trusted main/release and every other PR namespace, without exposing
`DEPOT_CACHE_TOKEN`.
Key prefixes, loopback proxies,
ephemeral runners and the org switches are not equivalent controls. A fresh
same-repository PR, fork PR and trusted-main seed/verify sentinel must prove
the selected behavior before the temporary exception is removed.
Bracketed IPv6 authorities use the fixed runner's Python 3.8+ stdlib
`ipaddress` classifier; parser absence/version/invalidity fails closed.
Attestation reports only value-free variable/reason classes and fails closed
on malformed or missing backend data.

Relevant repository variable names include `DEPOT_RUNNERS_ENABLED`,
`DEPOT_PR_RUNNERS_ENABLED` (global temporary exception gate),
`DEPOT_PR_CANARY_REF` (absent by default; one exact
`refs/pull/<number>/merge` ref only), `DEPOT_PR_SENTINEL_REF` (absent by
default; one exact same-repository merge ref used only by the protected
no-checkout authority diagnostic), and `DEPOT_PR_SENTINEL_ID` (absent by
default; exactly 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters when the diagnostic is
deliberately armed). The canary and sentinel variables are bounded selectors,
not cache-isolation proofs or replacements for the global PR gate. The normal
Quality runner policy continues to use `DEPOT_PR_CANARY_REF`; the sentinel
uses a separate selector output and cannot move the normal build jobs.
The eligible five-lane Depot graph disables every native GitHub cache consumer
when `allow_native_github_cache=false`. During the bounded exception eligible
same-repository PR and trusted-main Depot jobs set that output true for
cross-branch Depot Actions-cache reuse; direct Depot remote cache remains
false. This checked-in mode does not
prove the absence of ambient Depot/WebDAV authority, so the runtime sentinel
has recorded unsafe repository-scoped cross-trust authority and must be
redesigned and repeated successfully; no-secret/no-token, fork and provider-
parity canaries remain required. Other variables include `CUDA_VERSION`,
`VULKAN_SDK_VERSION`, smoke configuration variables, and release/deployment
variables. Secret values never belong in this inventory;
known names include `HF_TOKEN`, release-attestation keys, `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
and deployment tokens.

## Live inspection

Use read-only commands when live state matters:

```bash
gh workflow list --all --repo Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm
gh run list --repo Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm --limit 30
gh variable list --repo Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm
gh api repos/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/rulesets
gh api orgs/Mesh-LLM/actions/runner-groups
```

Organization runner-group responses of `403` are unverified administrative
state, not proof that a restriction is absent.

### Proposed retained-cohort identity evidence

Runner-images PR #23 is pending; its retained exact-attempt admission flow is
not yet the producer's merged-main behavior. After that producer flow lands,
`scripts/runner-image-identity.py bind` can prepare offline catalog proposals
from maintainer-reviewed admission anchors. The exact cohort bytes are retained
under `ci/runner-image-evidence/<sha256>.json`; ordinary commands validate hashes
and consumer relationships without executing producer code or authenticating
GitHub provenance again. See `ci/ci.md` for the explicit trust boundary and CLI.
Current image references and historical null evidence remain unchanged.

The `product-smoke` catalog role covers `smoke.yml`; accelerator and macOS paths
retain their existing container opt-outs. The inventory has 9 images, 35 roles
and 35 literal workflow image bindings.

### Qualified lean UI consumers

UI quality and ordinary UI artifacts use qualified public UI; E2E uses public
browser. Nonempty release tags keep UI artifact preparation on existing full web.
The catalog retains the admitted run `34256062098` attempt 1 cohort for UI/browser;
other historical receipts and CPU seed workload coverage remain unknown.
See [CI topology](../../../../ci/ci.md#qualified-lean-ui-consumers) for admission
scope and the required candidate-branch lane execution before merge.

### CPU runtime seed canary

`depot-canary.yml` has an isolated default-branch-only manual `runtime-seed` mode
with three cold/warm pairs on fresh GitHub-hosted CPU jobs. It restores only the
current image-bound, recipe-bound main seed,
never saves caches or changes production eligibility, and retains negative or
inconclusive results. The catalog tracks this qualification restore separately
from the five production restore-action bindings, including the explicitly
disabled runtime binding. See [CI topology](../../../../ci/ci.md#cpu-runtime-seed-canary)
for identity, measurements and the completed qualification limits.

Runtime exclusion evidence: run `34272984200/1`, source
`1f4545616e98db715e37c57e1196cbdc975a010e`, observed zero reuse in all three
verified warm samples. Full-cohort timing remains inconclusive because pairs 1/2
had different CPUs. See [retained evidence](../../../../ci/runtime-seed-evidence/34272984200-1/README.md).

## Console-print product scope

`just no-console-print` forbids the print macros and direct `io::stdout()` /
`io::stderr()` handles in product sources. There is no allowlist: every
exemption is a category rule, so no individual call site can be approved. Its
scope excludes test paths, parsed `#[cfg(test)]` modules, examples, benches,
auxiliary `src/bin/` targets and the explicit `NON_PRODUCT_CRATES` list in
`tools/xtask/src/no_console_print/scope.rs`. Build scripts remain excluded
because their output contains Cargo directives. `mesh-llm/src/main.rs` and
`mesh-client` remain in scope.

The handle rule exempts only the files that implement the console output
facility, listed as `CONSOLE_OUTPUT_OWNERS` in the same module: the sink-aware
writer and its pre-sink CLI fallback, the inline progress renderers, the TUI
output manager / fd capture / terminal backend, the runtime tracing writer,
skippy-server's stderr telemetry sink, and the CLI presentation surfaces.
A capability probe such as `io::stdout().is_terminal()` reads nothing and is
not a handle.

The gate checks Cargo metadata on every invocation and rejects an exempt crate
that becomes a transitive normal dependency of `mesh-llm`, including optional
and platform-specific dependencies. Tests cover that guard and the scope rules.
The Quality workflow still invokes the same `just no-console-print` gate.

The CPU native runtime-event gate selects `family-qwen3-dense` from the
`skippy-ci-smoke` manifest for both `pull-request` and `main` cadences. The
canonical artifact registry explicitly permits both uses, and the workflow
contract test resolves its selected model through the real manifest resolver.

The gate resolves bundle, model and evidence paths against the caller's working
directory before invoking Cargo. Cargo starts the integration test in its crate
directory; absolute paths keep its evidence writer and the wrapper's execution
check on the same file.


Full-session replay contract: [configuration and qualification](../../../../ci/agentic-replay-nightly/README.md).

## macOS deployment target

`scripts/lib/macos-deployment-target.txt` records the shared default (13.3),
matching the pinned llama.cpp
[Apple release](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/661643e43079a4ee6faab4c1895291767b67ea8d/.github/workflows/release.yml#L73)
and [XCFramework](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/661643e43079a4ee6faab4c1895291767b67ea8d/build-xcframework.sh#L8)
baseline. Just exports it unless the caller sets `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`.
Direct host/native builds and the canary harness load the same default; both
canary jobs export it for every subsequent Cargo/CMake step and include it in
compiler-cache identity. Native CMake receives the resolved target explicitly,
so its build stamp changes and old target objects are rebuilt. This changes
future builds, not running jobs or shared model caches.

Explicit SDK/platform overrides remain supported. The full Swift SDK passes
its selected macOS target to both Cargo and CMake while retaining its separate
iOS targets. Setting a deployment target is not proof of oldest-OS runtime
compatibility; validate on the minimum OS before making that claim.


### Mesh and Skippy physical-layout catalog prerequisite

The catalog registers future `mesh/crates/` and `skippy/crates/` paths alongside
existing paths, including product scripts, docs, website, SDK, deployment and
native sources. Future Mesh adapter, membership, control API and composition
crates select `runtime-product`. Unknown product subtrees still fail closed.

This additive prerequisite changes no source layout, slice, workflow, runner,
permission or protected catalog comparison. Land it on the protected default
branch before the dependent relocation; the latter must use identical catalogs.
Path consumers and Cargo discovery still require updates with the physical move.

Renamed frontend, serving, model and GPU benchmark crates retain their direct
semantic aliases. The current `skippy-model-package` name is reused by model
acquisition after extraction: retain its existing split-serving rule on main,
with model-download ownership on the relocated path. That conservatively runs
both domains until the later catalog cleanup; existing main routing is unchanged.

### Protected executor compatibility for the product extraction

The protected executor workflows pin both resolver actions to commit
`38d63b2f6e27998034fdf0452150c7cc081fe921`, so older PR source checkouts do not need
the new helper files. The package resolver loads its Python implementation
from that same pinned action checkout and inspects the candidate only through
Cargo metadata in the existing executor trust context.

`resolve-source-layout` resolves the checked-out console, website and SDK
source directories from the two supported layouts. Missing or ambiguous
components fail before producer/consumer work. UI build, artifact upload,
platform host restore, SDK restore and release checksum verification use the
same resolved directory; native ABI cache recipes include both native source
locations. Workspace CI script entrypoints remain at `scripts/`.

The protected planner still uses its own Cargo metadata and byte-identical
catalogs. `scripts/ci-cargo-packages.py` runs only in candidate executors and
translates a pre-extraction batch to its fixed successor owners when the
protected executor declares `--generation legacy` and the candidate contains
the extracted package builder. Explicit generation disambiguates the reused
package name even in a one-package plan. Matrix executors must switch to
`--generation current` in the same commit that migrates the protected workspace
package names; the fixed platform owner requests remain legacy selectors. It checks
successors against candidate Cargo workspace metadata, rejects unknown/missing
owners and preserves new-plan batches unchanged. The frozen old/new workspace
censuses verify all 75 extracted members have exactly one predecessor batch,
including the reused `skippy-model-package` name. This adds no matrix workers,
runner authority, permissions, catalog exception or skipped checks. Remove the
migration map only after protected main and all in-flight sources use the new
package names.

The SafeTensors smoke selects its exact ignored test from the host or extracted
adapter, asserts its presence, compiles once and retains the complete immutable
checkpoint/quantization sweep. Platform unit rows use the same source-owner
translation. Candidate workflow tests and local checks validate compatibility;
protected PR runs alone cannot certify a workflow definition that has not yet
landed on main.

Node addon release producers also resolve `sdk` or `mesh/sdk` before version
checks, native builds, npm pack and immutable artifact staging on Linux, macOS
and Windows. Executable fixtures cover all three producers in both layouts.

Legacy change-detection entrypoints and Windows cache triggers recognize both
product layouts. Nightly and explicit-revision canary pin readers accept exactly
one legacy or relocated pin, rejecting missing and ambiguous source trees.

Release version propagation discovers both relocated crate trees, including
versioned local dependencies, and resolves each versioned sidecar from the same
source layout, so a relocated-only checkout can propagate a version without a
root `website/`, `sdk/` or `docs/` tree. The website recipes consume the
directory the workflow resolved through `MESH_LLM_WEBSITE_DIR`, so the
`website-build` and `cli-inventory-check` boundaries cannot silently fall back to
a root `website/`. Neither change expands runner or cache authority.

Relocated runtime owners keep their consumers: the SDK-smoke and
inference-artifact selectors name `skippy-native-runtime` beside
`mesh-llm-native-runtime`, and a planner-level assertion locks every successor in
`scripts/ci-cargo-packages.py` to its predecessor's semantic domains. Three
successors (`skippy-hf-hub`, `skippy-api`, `skippy-events`) have no
`crate_rules` entry yet; the assertion records that exact set instead of hiding
it. `ci/ownership.yml` can only change on the protected branch, because the PR
plan step requires a source revision's catalogs to match the protected copies
byte for byte, so that catalog migration is a prerequisite before the map can be
narrowed and the recorded set can be emptied.

Executor batch translation and workspace membership stay separate: a mapped
successor that the checked-out revision does not have fails the batch, while an
unmapped planned package is passed through to the executor's workspace filter,
which drops and annotates it. A branch that predates a member added on the
default branch therefore still gets a verdict instead of a red lane.

### Canary memory admission and Python SDK

The controller projects each immutable source plan onto `family-certify` plus
`accelerator-memory-128plus` (115.2 GiB) or `accelerator-memory-256plus`
(230.4 GiB), reserving 10% of physical RAM. The source plan and its digest are
unchanged, including historical `mesh_ref` certification. Missing artifact sizes
and peaks beyond the larger tier fail planning. No family is silently skipped.
An optional source-owned `minimum_runner_memory_gib` value of 128 or 256 may
promote an estimate-selected row but cannot demote it; plans without the field
remain estimate-only. GLM-4.5-Air, Qwen4exp and Llama4 currently require the
256-plus tier through this policy.

`scripts/lib/canary_family_memory.py` uses the greater of pinned file sizes and
the model estimate, including projector/draft artifacts. Causal parity releases
the monolithic oracle before partitioned execution and releases state source
before restore: one aggregate weight copy plus a 25% tensor/KV/state/scratch
allowance and 2 GiB per each of three processes. Non-chat candidate/oracle
execution budgets two complete weight copies plus 25% and 2 GiB per process.
These are explicit admission estimates for the current short-context harness,
not measured peak guarantees; changes to concurrency/context require review.

The worker recomputes placement from the digest-verified plan, waits for one
pre-provisioned cross-account physical-host lock in the root-owned
`/Library/Application Support/MeshLLM/locks` directory, checks actual physical capacity and
available memory, and polls availability once per second while running the battery.
Expected contention between runner services on one machine is serialized rather
than reported as a family failure; the evidence records whether and how long the
worker waited. Available memory is macOS free + inactive + speculative pages;
purgeable pages are not counted twice. A reserve violation or monitoring failure
stops only this family's process group and fails certification.
`memory-admission.json` retains the estimate and host observations even on
failure. Sampling cannot guarantee that instantaneous allocations never cross
the reserve. Unrelated workloads must leave enough headroom at admission;
labels alone are insufficient.

Runner provisioning owns the lock path: create
`/Library/Application Support/MeshLLM/locks` as root with mode `0755`, and
pre-create `mesh-canary-family-host.lock` as root with mode `0666`. Jobs verify
both owner and permissions and never create the path themselves.

The shared `setup-canary-python` action restores `ci/canary-python/uv.lock` into
a controller-owned virtual environment and exports `SKIPPY_WORKLOAD_SDK_PYTHON`.
Historical source workers consume that exact SDK interpreter. This is managed
project dependency restoration, not an installation into system Python or the
read-only model cache. The runner still requires preinstalled `uv`.

### Self-hosted job disk cleanup

The persistent build and family jobs run `scripts/cleanup-self-hosted.py`
after artifact upload attempts, on success, failure and cancellation. It removes
known job-local Cargo debug outputs, prepared llama sources, native/workload
builds, downloaded handoffs and the worker SDK environment. Evidence and the
producer export are removed only when their respective uploads succeeded;
failed uploads retain the local copy for recovery. The helper validates bounded
run/pass/shard identities and refuses symlinked parent paths. Shared model,
compiler and package-download caches, source checkouts and other jobs' run-scoped
outputs are preserved. Force termination or runner loss can prevent cleanup;
this is not a host-wide garbage collector.

The same helper also owns bounded profiles for agentic replay, GPU smoke,
CUDA release and the amd64/arm64 runner-contract matrix. Replay creates its
build worktrees under the job's runner temporary directory and explicitly removes
only their Git registrations before deleting the root; unrelated registrations
are preserved. CUDA release explicitly saves its native
Actions cache before deleting build outputs; failed runtime uploads retain
`dist/native-runtimes`. Smoke removes its downloaded product and staged binary,
retaining shared model caches and diagnostic logs. Runner-contract removes its
Cargo target output. Hosted fallback rows retain their normal disposable-runner
lifecycle. The workflow contract test requires final cleanup for every declared
self-hosted job, including custom `mesh-llm-*` runner matrix labels.


The native Skippy suite includes sparse synthetic graph-contract tests for every
canary registry family. `scripts/tests/test_synthetic_graph_registry.py` makes
missing fixtures and registry dimension/MTP drift fail CI validation. The matrix
checks admitted stage chains and explicit unsupported contracts without model
weights; it does not confer real-model certification. See
`ci/llama-canary/SYNTHETIC_GRAPH_CONTRACTS.md` for structural coverage and limits.
